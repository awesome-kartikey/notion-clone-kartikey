## üîß Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Version 18.x.x or higher
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Convex Account:** Sign up at [convex.dev](https://convex.dev)
- **Clerk Account:** Sign up at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
- **EdgeStore Account:** Sign up at [edgestore.dev](https://edgestore.dev)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/awesome-kartikey/notion-clone-kartikey.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd notion-clone-kartikey
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following variables obtained from your service dashboards:

    ```env
    # --- Convex ---
    # Deployment used by `npx convex dev` (usually looks like dev:xxxxx)
    # Get from Convex dashboard -> Project Settings -> API Keys
    CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=
    # Your Convex project URL
    # Get from Convex dashboard -> Project Settings -> API Keys
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=

    # --- Clerk ---
    # Get these from your Clerk application dashboard -> API Keys
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

    # --- EdgeStore ---
    # Get these from your EdgeStore project dashboard -> API Keys
    EDGE_STORE_ACCESS_KEY=
    EDGE_STORE_SECRET_KEY=
    ```

    **Important Clerk Configuration:**

    - Go to your Clerk Dashboard.
    - Navigate to **JWT Templates**.
    - Create a new template based on the **Convex** preset.
    - Go to **API Keys**.
    - Under **Advanced** -> **Allowed Origins**, add your development URL (`http://localhost:3000`) and your future production URL.
    - Under **Advanced** -> **URL Whitelist**, add the path for Clerk webhooks if needed (not strictly required for this setup but good practice).

4.  **Set up Convex Backend:**
    Run the following command in your terminal. This command links your local project to your Convex deployment, pushes your schema (`convex/schema.ts`) and functions (`convex/*.ts`), and starts a local development server that proxies requests to your Convex backend. Keep this running in a separate terminal during development.

    ```bash
    npx convex dev
    ```

    - Follow the CLI prompts to log in to your Convex account and select the project/deployment if it's your first time running it for this project.

5.  **Run the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## üíª Usage

1.  **Sign Up / Log In:** Use the Clerk authentication forms accessible from the landing page.
2.  **Create a Note:** Once logged in, click the "New page" button or the "+" icon in the sidebar.
3.  **Edit Content:** Click into the main editor area to start typing. Use BlockNote's slash commands (`/`) or toolbar for formatting.
4.  **Organize Notes:** Drag and drop notes in the sidebar to nest them under other notes.
5.  **Add Icons/Covers:** Hover over the top of a note page to reveal buttons for adding an emoji icon or a cover image.

7.  **Search:** Press `‚åò+K` (or `Ctrl+K`) to open the search command menu and quickly find notes.
8.  **Trash:** Delete notes using the context menu in the sidebar or the top navbar menu. Access deleted notes via the "Trash" popover in the sidebar to restore or permanently delete them.
